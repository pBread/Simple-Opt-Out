## Usage

Initiate the verification process by going to `http://localhost:8080/opt-out/new?to=+12223334444`, but replace the phone number with your personal phone number. You should receive an SMS message.

Reply to the text message with and w/out the keyword `TESTER` to see what happens.

_NOTE: This example does not unsubscribe you when you respond with the keyword. You would have to update `func unsubscribe` to remove the post._
